# Dotfair

Dotfair aims to reduce your cloud infrastructure greenhouses gas emissions by providing a simple way to assess your carbon footprint with just
a terrafom file.

## Who is it for?

Dotfair is for anyone who wants to reduce their cloud infrastructure carbon footprint. It is especially useful for developers or operators that want to
reduce their carbon footprint and want to have a simple way to assess it.

## How does it work?

Dotfair uses the [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) configuration file to assess the carbon footprint of your cloud infrastructure. It uses the
[Boavizta API](https://boavizta.org/) to calculate the carbon footprint of your infrastructure.
